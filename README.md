# ItemStore

### Description
In this project, I implement a basic REST API that simulates a store that allows users to create, store, update, and delete items. This API also enables creation of users as well as authentication of those users.

### Tools/Libraries/Frameworks
The tools used in this project were `sqlite3` and `flask` (specifically `flask_restful` and `flask_jwt`).

### Resources
This project was completed with the assistance of the [REST APIs with Flask and Python](https://www.udemy.com/rest-api-flask-and-python/) course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com).
